Example of my PHP work

I have uploaded 3 files used on the management system I developed for the company I worked on.

First one is "contratos.php".
This file is related to the image below:
<img src="https://github.com/Dangirotto/php/blob/master/images/contratos.png" />
<br/>
This is a screen to manage all the current contracts/projects the company have.
It has a table showing the contract description, the client, the status and options to edit or delete it.
By clicking on a contract name the user is redirected to the next page, "acomp_contrato.php".
<hr>

This page has 3 parts:
<ul>
  <li>Contract details</li>
  <li>Expenses</li>
  <li>Incomes</li>
</ul><br/>
<b>Contract details</b>
Shows the basic data of the contract.
<b>Expenses</b>
Shows each category of expense, its expected value and its practiced value.
The categories and expected values are filled when creating a new contract, and the practiced value is calculated from all the expenses registered on the software.
<b>Incomes</b>
Shows all the incomes recieved from the client on this contract.
<br/>
By clicking on a category, the user is redirected to the next page, "acomp_contrato_cat.php".
<hr>
<img src="https://github.com/Dangirotto/php/blob/master/images/acomp_contrato_cat.png" />
This page shows a table with every single expense of that category/contract, with the following information:
<b>Document</b>
The name of the expense or document related to it.
<b>Value</b>
Its value.
<b>Date</b>
The expense date.
<b>Description</b>
Its description.
<b>Options</b>
There are several options to do with each expense:
<ul>
  <li>Pay (register this expense as paid)</li>
  <li>Edit</li>
  <li>Move to another category or contract</li>
  <li>Upload and image related to the expense</li>
  <li>Delete</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<hr>
I've uploaded one file for each of these screens, but I can't give access to the fully functional system for copyright and confidentiality issues.
Any doubt or if you wish to see any of the other functions I use, contact me.
<br/><br/>
Thank you!
